# Backup MySql databases from remote server

** Description
I have wordpress websites running on VPS server and I need a solution to backup these databases regulerly.
We will create an [[https://www.ansible.com][ansible]] palybook to automate the solution.

** Prerequisites
 - ssh key (make sure public key has been uploaded to remote server)
 - ansible
 - Instance of mysql running

* Crate playbook to run manually in command-line
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle database_backup_manual.yaml
  ---
  - hosts: Server-VPS
    gather_facts: true
    tasks:
      - name: Create variables
        set_fact:
          db_file_name: "db_backup/<db_name>_{{ ansible_date_time.date | replace('-','') }}.sql"
      
      - name: Confirm hostname
        debug:
          msg: Logged into the server.

      - name: Download Database to server
        shell: |
          mysqldump -u {{ db_user_name}} -p"{{ db_user_password }}" {{ db_name }} --single-transaction --quick --lock-tables=false > "{{ db_file_name }}" --no-tablespaces
        no_log: true

      - name: Wait until the database backup completed on server
        wait_for:
          path: "{{ db_file_name }}"
          state: present
          msg: "Timeout to find file {{ db_file_name }}"

      - name: Downloading backup to local computer
        ansible.builtin.fetch:
          src: "{{ db_file_name }}"
          dest: "{{ db_file_name }}"
          flat: yes

      - name: Download completed
        debug:
          msg: Database have been downloaded successfully.
#+END_SRC

Time to playbook to run manually in command-line:

** Step 1 - Run ssh-agent
If you have the passpharace added to ssh key then it will be easier to run it manually.

#+begin_src
  eval $(ssh-agent)
  ssh-add ./path/to/ssh/key
#+end_src

** Step 2 - Execute playbook
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ansible-playbook -i server.name.ini database_backup_manual.yaml --vault-password-file <path/to/ansible/vault/password/file>
#+END_SRC
